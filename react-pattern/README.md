## Introduction
This repository showcases an AI agent that can perform predefined actions based on user input. The agent uses the OpenAI API to process the input and determine the appropriate action to take.

ReAct is inspired by the synergies between "acting" and "reasoning" which allow humans to learn new tasks and make decisions or reasoning.


## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent.git
cd ai-agent/react-pattern
npm install
```

## Usage
To start the agent, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The agent will process the predefined question and perform actions based on the input.

## Actions
The agent can perform the following actions:

- **calculate**: Runs a calculation and returns the result.
  - Example: `calculate: 4 * 7 / 3`
- **average_dog_weight**: Returns the average weight of a dog when given the breed.
  - Example: `average_dog_weight: Border Collie`
